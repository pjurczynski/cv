            Allani is a startup based in Poland. It's main focus is fashion and to help the community to wear fashionably. You as a part of the community, can create your own outfit mix. Next you can mark your favourite clothes - save them - for future reference in case they will be availaible in a local store.

            This project born in my midtime working for Allani. Therefore I have been present on all brainstorm sessions. I have been responsible mainly for the front-end. I have been directed with decisions to select the best tools for the project. Then code the groundworks and leave the project for the next front-end engineer that was supposed to come after me.

            My first tasks were to introduce the most essential front-end improvments I could in a very tight schedule. We have managed to improve the visual quality of the page with a little sacrafice on the performance side. Later I was in charge of preparing A&B tests over some of the website features. Lastly I was partialy rebuilding the main tool on the site - [*The Creator*]( #/1/3 ).

            The best way to describe what The Creator is to [see it on live site]( http://allani.pl/zestawy/utworz ). It provides you with the ability to put products on canvas in order to make a unique outfit.

            The main purpose of the rebuild was to simplify the UI. 
            
            * I have visualy rebuilt the canvas on the left side.
            * The functionality of the menu on the right was build from the ground solely by my (apart form the search engine). Visually it was prepared for future front-end developer to polish the details.

            I've been recruited to work on a social site. Its core difference was to focus on *positivity*. All news published on a site had to have some positive outcome. Tools that we were going to develop had to inform you about something good. ex. We had a complimentator widget that embeded a video clip with a compliment for you.

            With a given photoshop layout, I had to create a launching page.
            Its functionality came down to two things:
            * A counter which displayed remaining days until launch date,
            * A newsletter module (subscribing and displaying former news).

            For the main social page I was given instructions to build a calendar widget with an internal API for other widgets to communicate with it.

            Goal of this project was to create a very simple archive of publishers books. Client didn't want to sell books directly on the website so We've decided to go with the wordpress engine. Also to cut costs we've found an ideal template on [Theme Forest](http://themeforest.net) that we could implement in our vision.

The goal was simple &ndash; create a website with the latest boots collection. The page itself was meant to stay intact for the whole year. At the end of each year there will be a complete redesign.

            As a page is going to change once a year without any changes in between, we've decided to put up a static design. Although the site might had been composed of pure html, I have decided to create a very simple php templating engine. This helped me to conform with changing concepts during development.
            
            Basicly my responsibilities was to:
            * chop the photoshop layout,
            * create a simple php templating engine.
