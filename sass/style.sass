// Here's where we define some default constants
@import partials/mixins
@import partials/variables

// Then we'll import the compass extension
@import h5bp

// Now, you can simply include everything
// (except print and helpers) by uncommeting this line
@include h5bp-normalize
@include h5bp-chromeframe

// Or, you can import the "overrides" partial if
// you want more control over individual mixins
//@import "partials/overrides";

// Finally, put your own styles in these partials
// and add more as needed (i.e. forms, tables, nav)
@import partials/fonts
@import partials/base
@import partials/layout
@import partials/typography
@import partials/lists
@import partials/cv

// Helpers classes should come second-to-last

// Media should come last
@import partials/media
//@import partials/development
